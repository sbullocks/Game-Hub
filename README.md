# Game Hub

Project 1.

* We connected 2 APIs via JavaScript to power our Game Hub application. The Game Hub allows a user to search for games by title and they will be presented with data regarding their search. User can then watch a popular video from YouTube related to that game search. User can also search by console and will be presented with the latest information regarding their search.

## Nav Bar

The navigation bar is always located at the top of the webpage so that it is easily accessible. It includes links to the most popular consoles for quick access to that specific section of the home page. If user is on any page other than the home page, the nave bar will include a "Home" link so you can easily return home.

## Carousel

Upon loading the home page, the user will be presented with a self-scrolling carousel. The user can interact with it by clicking on a game image or by clicking the left/right arrows to scroll manually. 

* The games are picked to display randomly.

The user has 2 different search options. 

* User can use the dropdown search box to select a specific console they want to pull the latest news on.

OR

* User can use the Search for a Game text box to type in a specific game title. This will then return results specific to the searched game title.
